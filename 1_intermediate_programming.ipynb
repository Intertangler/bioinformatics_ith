        "Now that you can make and access various data structures like strings, lists, and numpy array, as well as create for-loops and if statements, there is actually not all that much else new to learn in terms of basic programming elements. Look at any professional piece of code and you will mostly see these many instances and permutations of these basic elements plus a variety of exotic functions from external libraries. The emphasis from here on is going to be more on problem solving - taking what you know and applying without the explicit instruction of what building blocks to implement. \n",

In your explanations, try not to focus on simply describing the code, and don't just describe the output or what the programs is supposed to produce (we know all that!), instead explain the purpose of intermediate steps and the rationale and structure behind the process that leads to the output.\n"

Now we are at the stage when we have some concrete ideas on things we may need, but not yet a clear line to the finish.

The answer we learn (after a bit of Googling for \"what are the 4 values in image data\") is that we are dealing with an RGBA image.

Since the image begins and ends in spot locations, if we were to go through our image matrix (either going row by row or column by column), we should hit a spot pixel every time so long as we only check every 25 elements. The 0th spot should be located at pixels [0,0]. There should then be another spot at [0, 25], and yet another at [0, 50], and another at [0, 75]. In fact we could say that spot locations are microarray locations times 25.
